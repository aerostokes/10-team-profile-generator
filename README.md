## Installation
NOTE: Requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
1. Clone the repo to your local machine.
2. With the cloned location as the active directory, install the npm dependencies from terminal with the command `npm i`.  

## Usage

With the cloned location as the active directory, run the application from terminal with the command `node index.js`.  
Follow the prompts in the terminal to add, edit, and preview your detailed team roster. When your roster is complete, select "Finish: Build the Team Page".
The application will create the webpage in the local '/dist' folder named '[teamname].html'. If a file already exists, you will be prompted whether to edit the team name to create a unique filename or overwrite the existing file.
